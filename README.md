The application login/registration flow uses Firebase authentication API, and allows<br> for user registration with email and password, and also allows for Sign In with <br>your Google Account, or the registered email and password.

The application is also integrated with Vercel to create a CI/CD pipeline which auto<br> deploys when changes are checked in into the main branch.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm install` or `yarn`

To install the all the needed node modules and:

##### `npm start` or `yarn start`

To start the application

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

##### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
