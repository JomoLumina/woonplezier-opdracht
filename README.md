The application login/registration flow uses Firebase authentication API, and allows<br> for user registration with email and password, and also allows for Sign In with <br>your Google Account, or the registered email and password.

It also allows for anonymous sign in, which just takes you to the hope page and bypasses the signing in part.

This application was created to function on devices of all difference sizes.

Create React was used to create this application and the styling uses the React Scripts of makeStyles because in that way
I am able to theme the entire application<br> easier with styles that can work through out the application.

The application is also integrated with Vercel to create a CI/CD pipeline which auto<br> deploys when changes are checked in into the main branch.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm install` or `yarn`

To install the all the needed node modules and:

##### `npm start` or `yarn start`

To start the application

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

##### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
